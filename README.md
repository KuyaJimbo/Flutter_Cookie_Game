# cookie_game

A Flutter project inspired by the Cookie Clicker Game! I created this as a challenge to myself to see how well I understood how to create models, pages, providers, and functionality in Dart to make a working clicker game in Flutter. If I return to this in the future, I will add a clock which allows the purchased factories to raise your total cookie count by their production values.

# What I Learned/Demonstrated:
- Basics of Dart Syntax for Flutter Apps
- Basics of creating custom models and pages in Dart
- Riverpod as a State Management Solution
- Navigation to different pages

# How to Run:

1. Download and Unzip the file.
2. Open the terminal at the unzipped folder.
3. Enter flutter run
